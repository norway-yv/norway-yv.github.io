        <h1>My projects</h1>
        <p>I have made tons more than this, mainly for scientific and mathematic purposes, but these are some of the projects I am most proud of:</p>
        <h2>kode24-calculator</h2>
        <p>An ongoing project, where I try to calculate expected wage for Norwegian developers using many different parametres.<br>
            For more information, see <a href="projects/kode24-calculator.html"> here. </a></p>
        <h2>binary-calculator</h2>
        <p>A project that is finished, but still has a long way to go. Currently, it can calculate the sum of two binary numbers output it.<br>
            For more information, see <a href="projects/binary-calculator.html"> here. </a></p>
        <h2>wifi-fixer-WANG</h2>
        <p>Another project that is finished, and tries to reconnect to the WiFi using some fancy trickery with IP adresses (just kidding, it renews it).<br>
            For more information, see <a href="projects/wifi-fixer-WANG.html">here.</a></p>
        <h2>train-information</h2>
        <p>Got to keep the streak of finished projects up! This is finished, and gives you a link to a departure/arrival board for a Norwegian train station using a GUI.<br>
            For more information, see <a href="projects/train-information.html">here.</a> To use the application, see <a href="projects/train-information">here.</a></p>
