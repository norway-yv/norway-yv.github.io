        <h1>wifi-fixer-WANG</h1>
        <p>This is originally made to work on the WANG Wi-Fi (my work/school Wi-Fi), but can work for others too. It works by releasing and renewing the IP adress using ipconfig, before resetting winsock and if nothing else works resetting ip with netsh. It should work in most of the situations where the WANG network falls out, and most probably other Wi-Fi networks too.</p>
        <h3>README.md</h3>
        <p>The following is what I have included in the README file in the GitHub repository:<br>
        <i>PowerShell script to fix the WiFi connection when using the WANG network from a wangelev.local computer.<br>
            <b>Why I created this</b><br>
            I am a student at WANG Upper Secondary School in Oslo. We have a terrible WiFi: It falls out whenever it wants to. Everyone is tired of this, so I made this script that can help.<br>
            <b>How to download</b><br>
            Download wififix.ps1 and save it wherever you want. Then, create a shortcut wherever you want (e.g. on your desktop), and input the following as the path:<br>
            C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File PUT_THE_PATH_TO_WIFIFIX_HERE_BUT_WITHOUT_QUOTATION_MARKS<br>
            Press the icon as soon as your wifi goes out (it might work for other issues on other WiFies too), and wait for it to work! When the script is done, your WiFi should be reconnected.<br>
            <b>Running the script</b><br>
            The instructions are in Norwegian, as I made this for my fellow Norwegian students. However, the Y/N option asks if it worked (i.e. if the WiFi reconnected). If you answer N, you must restart when the next lines of text have been written.</i></p>
